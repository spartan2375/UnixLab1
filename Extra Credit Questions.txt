1. I think the meta characters fail because the shell isn't interpretting
   the characters as redirects as a fully flushed out shell like bash would.
   It seems like the shell is interpretting them as files, which don't exist.

2. I think . and .. are standardized "macros" on linux, whereas the others are not.

3. find expects an expression as an argument, and it parses the argument as an expression.
   Our shell expects file names, not expressions, so it fails to parse the expressions and
   complains that the file we are passing as an argument does not exist.
